# AEOLUS
**AEOLUS** is a private cloud design and implementation project intended for remote storage and management of files. The system is hosted on a Linux private server and guarantees safe access to multiple users from many devices, given previous successful authentication.

The application is designed to work on older systems with limited resources, as it uses Debian Bookworm as its base operating system and KVM as the cloud platform; we seek a balance between complex functionality and minimal resource consumption.
